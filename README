The LuaTeX package 'lua-visual-debug' shows boxes, glues, kerns and
penalties in the PDF output.

Usage:

LaTeX:

\usepackage{lua-visual-debug}

or (plain)

\input lua-visual-debug.sty



Requirements: The package has only been tested with LuaTeX and
  the formats plain and LaTeX. Other formats might work as well,
  but other engines only show a warning message.
